## Minimum Viable Product:
Project Description: The Youth Soccer (Futbol) League is getting ready to set up their league and have asked for a quick console based app. They'd like to create teams, assign players to them fairly and then print out a roster for each team. Registration has closed, so no new players can be added to the master list of players. There is a class with a static method that is available to you named Players.load which will return you with a fixed array of all the registered players. Coaches will print out a roster once teams are built, so do not worry about saving (or serializing) the teams that the organizer will be building. The league has teams and teams have players. Theyâ€™ve asked that we make sure that teams cannot have the same player added twice. If you use the proper collection for the team.players, you should be able to ensure uniqueness. Teams can have a maximum of 11 players each.


- As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me to create a new team, so that I can build the season.
- As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me to add players to a team, so that I can build fair teams.
- As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me to remove players from a team, so that I can attempt to produce more fair teams.
- As an organizer adding or removing a player to a yet to be chosen team, I should be prompted with an alphabetically ordered list of teams to choose from, so that I can quickly locate the team and avoid typos.
- As an organizer adding or removing a player to a chosen team, I should be prompted with an alphabetically ordered list of players along with their stats, so that I can quickly locate the player and take action.
- As an organizer planning teams, I should be able to view a Height report of a chosen team grouped by height, so that I can determine if teams are fair.
- As an organizer who is planning teams, I should be able to see a League Balance Report for all teams in the league showing a total count of experienced players vs. inexperienced players, so I can determine from a high level if the teams are fairly balanced regarding previous experience. The report should use a map like solution to properly report experienced vs. inexperienced for each team.
- As a coach of a team, I should be able to print out a roster of all the players on my team, so that I can plan appropriately.
